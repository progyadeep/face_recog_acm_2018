# WHAT IS THIS
This is a program written in python using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/" target="_blank">face_recognition</a> module. It can be <b>trained using a set of known images</b> and then the program will recognize the supplied image accordingly.

# HOW IT WORKS
A detailed documentation is available in the file <a href="https://github.com/progyadeep/face_recog_acm_2018/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md">DOCUMENTATION.md</a>.<br/>
Here's a brief overview of the working.

<ul>
<li> The folder <b>known_faces</b> contains all the known faces. Inside this folder, there are <b>n subfolders</b> named after the label of the faces they contain</li>
<li> The files <b>known_encodings.txt</b> and <b>known_names.txt</b> contain the information retrieved from the known faces, and their respective labels, respectively. This information is generated by the file <b>trainer.py</b> and will be needed later to recognize a given image.</li>
<li> The file <b>trainer.py</b>, as the name suggests, is the trainer. it extracts face encodings from the known images and places them in the <b>known_encodings.txt</b> file, and their labels in the <b>known_names.txt<b>.</li>
<li> The file <b>recognize.py</b> uses the data generated by the trainer to recognize a given image.</li>
</ul>
